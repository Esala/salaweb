            This is the first time that this Master has been done, and that is a good opportunity to learn how is this experience is for every one of us and to learn more about each other. The group of students is small but very diverse in profiles, making very interesting explore the expectations and how each class is perceived by each profile.
            </p>
            <p>

Also, I think is important to understand more about the experience, not only in how is related to a profile but also the daily and work-life of each student. For that, I will be also interested in data like location, travel time, weather, work habits, etc.
</p>
<p>

I believe that each designer has different skills related to their field of expertise or personal interest, and being this Master very multidisciplinary and with no previous information (projects, testimonies, etc), with this research, I expect to find how different profiles of designers and students create their own path based on their personal and professional interests.

            It could be useful to know our expectations and challenges within this program. Understand how each profile is better for each class and who is more interested in different topics could be useful for future projects.

            <h4>Understand the experience</h4>

              I will create a piece that helps to understand the experience of the students. I hope that this helps a new student to decide if this program will fulfill their expectations and understand how difficult could be, based on the intrinsic knowledge of each profile and the personal situation in Barcelona.

              I will print and share these cards for each class. I think a printed piece is better to capture the feelings of the moment. Later I will put the collected information to a digital format to process it.

          <h4>Limitations</h4>
            <p>
            The main limitation of this project is time. If I look at the data per class I only will achieve 4 instances.
            </p><p>
But even if that is the case, 4 classes are almost half of the total instances of each quarterly class. And for the nature of the objective of this project, that is getting an idea of how interesting and difficult is each class for each profile, It seems like the information will be relevant.
            </p><p>
Other information, like weather, could be more relevant to find correlations if I collect data for more time. In a month maybe the weather is more or less the same and no interesting findings appear. For example, comparing December to June, seems more relevant than comparing 20 of October to 10 of November. But I'm hoping to find some correlation between assistance or lateness and a very cold day or a rainy week, or at least find that there is no correlation at all.
            </p><p>
The good thing is that the group has only 6 students, which means that I can study the whole population.
            </p><p>
Taking this limitations into account, I will look the data in 2 ways to try to arrive at better conclusions:
            </p>
            <div className="blog__list">
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Specific</strong> <br/>
                  Looking for which class is more interesting or difficult, and how different profiles share or not characteristics.<br/><br/>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Global</strong> <br/>
                  Looking to answer questions like, is this program being too difficult? is interesting for all or just for some profiles? Is being too difficult to assist for some profiles?
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Interferences</h4>
            <p>
              Data like assistance or lateness can represent a lack of interest but also could be a problem in the city or public transportation, a rainy or very cold day. To avoid only have one part of the information I want to have information about location, the way students travel to Elisava, how and where they work, etc. That will give me a bigger picture of the situation.
            </p>

            <h4>Further possibilities</h4>
            <p>
            This project could be a lot more relevant with the data of the whole program and classes, but this first step could be useful to test the idea and see if the information can give us interesting insights.
